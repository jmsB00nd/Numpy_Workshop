# NumPy Workshop - Machine Learning Class

This repository contains the code and materials used during the NumPy workshop conducted as part of the Machine Learning course at the Higher National School of Computer Science, Algiers.

## Overview

The purpose of this workshop was to provide hands-on experience with the NumPy library, a fundamental package for numerical computation in Python. Participants learned how to manipulate arrays, perform vectorized operations, and apply key functions that are essential for machine learning applications.

### Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to NumPy:**
   - Installing and importing NumPy
   - Basic operations on arrays
   - Array creation, reshaping, and indexing
   
2. **Array Manipulation:**
   - Slicing and dicing arrays
   - Concatenating and splitting arrays
   - Transposing arrays and broadcasting

3. **Mathematical Operations:**
   - Element-wise operations
   - Statistical functions (mean, median, variance)
   - Linear algebra (matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, etc.)

4. **Advanced Features:**
   - Boolean indexing
   - Vectorized operations
   - Working with random numbers and simulations

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
